# Project Overview

This repository contains two distinct projects related to our testing and algorithm assignments:

1. **eigen-test**: A NestJS application focusing on library test assignments.
2. **eigen_algorithm_test**: Code related to algorithm assignments.

Each folder has its own `README.md` to provide detailed instructions specific to that project. Below is an overview of each project and a brief guide on how to get started with them.

## Folder Structure

- **eigen-test**: Contains the NestJS application for library test assignments.
- **eigen_algorithm_test**: Contains the code for algorithm assignments.

## eigen-test

The `eigen-test` folder includes a NestJS application designed for testing library assignments. 

## eigen_algorithm_test

The `eigen_algorithm_test` folder contains code for algorithm assignments. This project is designed to implement and test various algorithms.
